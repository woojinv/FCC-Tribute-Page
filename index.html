            <h3>From Saul to the Apostle Paul</h3>
                <p>
                    Paul was first born in Rome and raised in Tarsus, 
                    studying under the supervision of Gamaliel, 
                    one of the most noted teachers of Jewish Law in history.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So devout for the Jewish law was he that with the rise of Christianity after the death and resurrection of Jesus, 
                    he approved of the stoning of a man named Stephen, an avid supporter of the famous Nazarene.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Saul continued his perscution, dragging off men and women of the church to prison.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He decided specifically to target the believers at Damascus, but on his way there, his life was forever-changed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He has a supernatural experience encountering Jesus, AFTER his crucifixion, and leaves the encounter blind, 
                    needing to be led by hand the remainder of the journey. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    A few days later, he recovers his sight, and begins to proclaim Jesus as the Son of God in the synagogue at Damascus,
                    the very message he was going there to destroy. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    From that point on he begins travelling all around the Mediterranean Sea planting churches and preaching the message of Jesus Christ. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    During all this, he suffers imprisonments, countless near-death beatings, nearly 200 lashes to the back, beatings with rods, stoning, shipwrecks,
                    sleepless nights, hunger, thirst, cold, and exposure to the elements. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, Paul is arrested in Jerusalem due to his adversaries inciting the city against him. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    He is transported to Caesarea to be judged by Felix the governor, where he remains in prison for the next two years. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    He is tried at court once again by his accusers, and he makes an appeal to Caesar, where it is decided that he will be shipped to Rome.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After suffering a shipwreck, he eventually makes it to Rome, but it turns out that no one in Rome actually wants to accuse him or keep him in prison.
                    However, they have heard much about him, and desire to hear what he has to say about Jesus. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    For two whole years he continue to preach the gospel of christianity in Rome and eventually, dies a martyr.
                </p>
                <p>
                    300 years later, Christianity becomes the official religion of the Roman Empire. 
                </p>
